# Certificate Authority

## Project Description

A decentralized certificate issuance system built on the Aptos blockchain that enables educational institutions, training organizations, and certification bodies to issue tamper-proof digital certificates. This smart contract provides a transparent and verifiable way to manage certificate issuance while ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize credential verification by creating a decentralized, transparent, and immutable certificate authority system that eliminates the need for centralized verification processes. Our vision is to build a global network where certificates can be instantly verified by anyone, anywhere, without relying on traditional intermediaries.
